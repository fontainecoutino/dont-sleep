# dont-sleep

TUI app to prevent system from sleeping.

## Background

Sometimes I need to keep my computer awake. I noticed it's either waiting for some time to pass or for a process to end.

[Caffeinate](https://ss64.com/mac/caffeinate.html ) is a Mac utility that solves this issue; however, I need ascii art and a nice moving pic (_I'm gen-z btw_).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A machine running MacOS (x-86) is required which includes [Caffeinate](https://ss64.com/mac/caffeinate.html ) by default.

### Installation

Clone and build

```
git clone https://github.com/fontainecoutino/dont-sleep.git 
go build -o dont-sleep dont-sleep/main.go
```

## Additional

* I hope to include other systems as well; however, I work exclusively on a Mac.
